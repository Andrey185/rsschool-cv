### I am 35 years old. I have been studying the front-end on my own for about two months. I have an engineering education and a mathematical mindset, so Iâ€™m used to puzzles in logic. I want to master a specialty in which only your personal qualities, skills and ambitions, not your mood, will affect the final result boss or other meteorological disasters. <br>
### *Graduated from BNTU*, faculty of 'industrial and civil construction'. Worked in the specialty for more than ten years. I have no experience in programming, I do it myself under the supervision of a mentor.
